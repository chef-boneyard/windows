[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9x4uepmm1g4rktie/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ChefWindowsCookbooks/windows/branch/master) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/windows.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/windows)

Provides a set of Windows-specific resources to aid in the creation of cookbooks/recipes targeting the Windows platform.

## Requirements

### Platforms

- Windows 7
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows 8, 8.1
- Windows Server 2012 (R1, R2)
- Windows Server 2016

### Chef

- Chef 13.4+

## Resources

### Deprecated Resources Note

As of Chef Client 14.0+ the auto_run, feature, feature_dism, feature_powershell, font, pagefile, printer_port, printer, and shortcut resources are now included in the Chef Client. If you are running Chef 14+ the resources in Chef client will take precedence over the resources in this cookbook. In April 2019 we will release a new major version of this cookbook that removes these resources.

As of Chef 14.7+ the windows_share and windows_certificate resources are now included in the Chef Client. If you are running Chef 14.7+ the resources in Chef client will take precedence over the resources in this cookbook. In November 2019 we will release a new major version of this cookbook that removes these resources.

### windows_auto_run

`Note`: This resource is now included in Chef 14 and later. There is no need to depend on the Windows cookbook for this resource.

#### Actions

- `:create` - Create an item to be run at login
- `:remove` - Remove an item that was previously setup to run at login

#### Properties

- `program_name` - Name property. The name of the value to be stored in the registry
- `path` - The program to be run at login. This property was previous named `program`. Cookbooks using the `program` property will continue to function, but should be updated.
- `args` - The arguments for the program
- `root` - The registry root key to put the entry under--`:machine` (default) or `:user`

#### Examples

Run BGInfo at login

```ruby
windows_auto_run 'BGINFO' do

  action  :create
end
```

### windows_certificate

`Note`: This resource is now included in Chef 14.7 and later. There is no need to depend on the Windows cookbook for this resource.

Installs a certificate into the Windows certificate store from a file, and grants read-only access to the private key for designated accounts. Due to current limitations in WinRM, installing certificated remotely may not work if the operation requires a user profile. Operations on the local machine store should still work.

#### Actions

- `:create` - creates or updates a certificate.
- `:delete` - deletes a certificate.
- `:acl_add` - adds read-only entries to a certificate's private key ACL.
- `:verify` - logs whether or not a certificate is valid

#### Properties

- `source` - name attribute. The source file (for create and acl_add), thumbprint (for delete and acl_add) or subject (for delete).
- `pfx_password` - the password to access the source if it is a pfx file.
- `private_key_acl` - array of 'domain\account' entries to be granted read-only access to the certificate's private key. This is not idempotent.
- `store_name` - the certificate store to manipulate. One of:
  - MY (Personal)
  - CA (Intermediate Certification Authorities)
  - ROOT (Trusted Root Certification Authorities)
  - TRUSTEDPUBLISHER (Trusted Publishers)
  - CLIENTAUTHISSUER (Client Authentication Issuers)
  - REMOTE DESKTOP (Remote Desktop)
  - TRUSTEDDEVICES (Trusted Devices)
  - WEBHOSTING (Web Hosting)
  - AUTHROOT (Third-Party Root Certification Authorities)
  - TRUSTEDPEOPLE (Trusted People)
  - SMARTCARDROOT (Smart Card Trusted Roots)
  - TRUST (Enterprise Trust)
  - DISALLOWED (Untrusted Certificates)
- `user_store` - if false (default) then use the local machine store; if true then use the current user's store.

#### Examples

```ruby
# Add PFX cert to local machine personal store and grant accounts read-only access to private key
windows_certificate "c:/test/mycert.pfx" do
    pfx_password    "password"
    private_key_acl    ["acme\fred", "pc\jane"]
end
```

```ruby
# Add cert to trusted intermediate store
windows_certificate "c:/test/mycert.cer" do
    store_name    "CA"
end
```

```ruby
# Remove all certificates matching the subject
windows_certificate "me.acme.com" do

### windows_feature

`Note`: This resource is now included in Chef 14 and later. There is no need to depend on the Windows cookbook for this resource.

**BREAKING CHANGE - Version 3.0.0**

This resource has been moved from using LWRPs and multiple providers to using Custom Resources. To maintain functionality, you'll need to change `provider` to `install_method`.

Windows Roles and Features can be thought of as built-in operating system packages that ship with the OS. A server role is a set of software programs that, when they are installed and properly configured, lets a computer perform a specific function for multiple users or other computers within a network. A Role can have multiple Role Services that provide functionality to the Role. Role services are software programs that provide the functionality of a role. Features are software programs that, although they are not directly parts of roles, can support or augment the functionality of one or more roles, or improve the functionality of the server, regardless of which roles are installed. Collectively we refer to all of these attributes as 'features'.

This resource allows you to manage these 'features' in an unattended, idempotent way.

There are two underlying resources that power `windows_feature` which map to the available installation systems on supported releases of Windows: [Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd371719%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) and [PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731774(v=ws.11).aspx). Chef will set the default method to `:windows_feature_dism` if `dism.exe` is present on the system being configured and otherwise use `:windows_feature_powershell`.

For more information on Roles, Role Services and Features see the [Microsoft TechNet article on the topic](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754923.aspx). For a complete list of all features that are available on a node type either of the following commands at a command prompt:

For Dism:

```text
dism /online /Get-Features
```

For PowerShell:

```text
get-windowsfeature
```

#### Actions

- `:install` - install a Windows role/feature
- `:remove` - remove a Windows role/feature
- `:delete` - remove a Windows role/feature from the image

#### Properties

- `feature_name` - name of the feature/role(s) to install. The same feature may have different names depending on the underlying resource being used (ie DHCPServer vs DHCP; DNS-Server-Full-Role vs DNS).
- `all` - Boolean. Optional. Default: false. For DISM this is the equivalent of specifying the /All switch to dism.exe, forcing all parent dependencies to be installed. With the PowerShell install method, the `-InstallAllSubFeatures` switch is applied. Note that these two methods may not produce identical results.
- `management_tools` - Boolean. Optional. Default: false. PowerShell only. Includes the `-IncludeManagementTools` switch. Installs all applicable management tools of the roles, role services, or features specified by the feature name.
- `source` - String. Optional. Uses local repository for feature install.
- `timeout` - Integer. Optional. Default: 600\. Specifies a timeout (in seconds) for feature install.
- `install_method` - Symbol. Optional. If not supplied, Chef will determine which method to use (in the order of `:windows_feature_dism`, `:windows_feature_servercmd`, `:windows_feature_powershell`)

#### Examples

Install the DHCP Server feature

```ruby
windows_feature 'DHCPServer' do
  action :install
end
```

Install the .Net 3.5.1 feature on Server 2012 using repository files on DVD and install all dependencies with a timeout of 900 seconds

```ruby
windows_feature "NetFx3" do
  action :install
  all true
  source "d:\sources\sxs"
  timeout 900
end
```

Remove Telnet Server and Client features

```ruby
windows_feature ['TelnetServer', 'TelnetClient'] do
  action :remove
end
```

Add the SMTP Server feature using the PowerShell provider

```ruby
windows_feature "smtp-server" do
  action :install
  all true
  install_method :windows_feature_powershell
end
```

Install multiple features using one resource with the PowerShell provider

```ruby
windows_feature ['Web-Asp-Net45', 'Web-Net-Ext45'] do
  action :install
  install_method :windows_feature_powershell
end
```

Install the Network Policy and Access Service feature, including the management tools. Which, for this example, will automatically install `RSAT-NPAS` as well.

```ruby
windows_feature 'NPAS' do
  action :install
  management_tools true
  install_method :windows_feature_powershell
end
```

### windows_font

`Note`: This resource is now included in Chef 14 and later. There is no need to depend on the Windows cookbook for this resource.

Installs font files. Sources the font by default from the cookbook, but a URI source can be specified as well.

#### Actions

- `:install` - install a font to the system fonts directory.

#### Properties

- `font_name` - The file name of the font file name to install. The path defaults to the files/default directory of the cookbook you're calling windows_font from. Defaults to the resource name.
- `source` - A local filesystem path or URI to source the font file from..

#### Examples

```ruby
windows_font 'Code New Roman.otf'

windows_font 'Custom.otf' do
  source "https://example.com/Custom.otf"

### windows_http_acl

Sets the Access Control List for an http URL to grant non-admin accounts permission to open HTTP endpoints.

#### Actions

- `:create` - creates or updates the ACL for a URL.
- `:delete` - deletes the ACL from a URL.

#### Properties

- `url` - the name of the url to be created/deleted.
- `sddl` - the DACL string configuring all permissions to URL. Mandatory for create if user is not provided. Can't be use with `user`.
- `user` - the name (domain\user) of the user or group to be granted permission to the URL. Mandatory for create if sddl is not provided. Can't be use with `sddl`. Only one user or group can be granted permission so this replaces any previously defined entry. If you receive a parameter error your user may not exist.

#### Examples

```ruby
windows_http_acl 'http://+:50051/' do
    user 'pc\\fred'
end
```

```ruby
# Grant access to users "NT SERVICE\WinRM" and "NT SERVICE\Wecsvc" via sddl

### windows_printer

`Note`: This resource is now included in Chef 14 and later. There is no need to depend on the Windows cookbook for this resource.

Create Windows printer. Note that this doesn't currently install a printer driver. You must already have the driver installed on the system.

The Windows Printer resource will automatically create a TCP/IP printer port for you using the `ipv4_address` property. If you want more granular control over the printer port, just create it using the `windows_printer_port` resource before creating the printer.

#### Actions

- `:create` - Create a new printer
- `:delete` - Delete an existing printer

#### Properties

- `device_id` - Printer queue name, e.g. 'HP LJ 5200 in fifth floor copy room'. Name property.
- `comment` - Optional string describing the printer queue.
- `default` - Boolean. Optional. Defaults to false. Note that Windows sets the first printer defined to the default printer regardless of this setting.
- `driver_name` - String. Required. Exact name of printer driver. Note that the printer driver must already be installed on the node.
- `location` - Printer location, e.g. 'Fifth floor copy room', or 'US/NYC/Floor42/Room4207'

- `share_name` - Printer share name.
- `ipv4_address` - Printer's IPv4 address, e.g. '10.4.64.23'. You don't have to be able to ping the IP address to set it. Required.

An error of "Set-WmiInstance : Generic failure" is most likely due to the printer driver name not matching or not being installed.

#### Examples

Create a printer

```ruby
windows_printer 'HP LaserJet 5th Floor' do
  driver_name 'HP LaserJet 4100 Series PCL6'
  ipv4_address '10.4.64.38'
end
```

Delete a printer. Note: this doesn't delete the associated printer port. See `windows_printer_port` above for how to delete the port.

```ruby
windows_printer 'HP LaserJet 5th Floor' do
  action :delete
end
```

### windows_zipfile

Most version of Windows do not ship with native cli utility for managing compressed files. This resource provides a pure-ruby implementation for managing zip files. Be sure to use the `not_if` or `only_if` meta parameters to guard the resource for idempotence or action will be taken every Chef run.

#### Actions

- `:unzip` - unzip a compressed file
- `:zip` - zip a directory (recursively)

#### Properties

- `path` - name attribute. The path where files will be (un)zipped to.
- `source` - source of the zip file (either a URI or local path) for :unzip, or directory to be zipped for :zip.
- `overwrite` - force an overwrite of the files if they already exist.
- `checksum` - for :unzip, useful if source is remote, if the local file matches the SHA-256 checksum, Chef will not download it.

#### Examples

Unzip a remote zip file locally

```ruby
windows_zipfile 'c:/bin' do
  source 'http://download.sysinternals.com/Files/SysinternalsSuite.zip'
  action :unzip
  not_if {::File.exists?('c:/bin/PsExec.exe')}
end
```

Unzip a local zipfile

```ruby
windows_zipfile 'c:/the_codez' do
  source 'c:/foo/baz/the_codez.zip'
  action :unzip
end
```

Create a local zipfile

```ruby
windows_zipfile 'c:/foo/baz/the_codez.zip' do
  source 'c:/the_codez'
  action :zip
end
```

## Libraries

### WindowsHelper

Helper that allows you to use helpful functions in windows

#### installed_packages

Returns a hash of all DisplayNames installed

```ruby
# usage in a recipe
::Chef::Recipe.send(:include, Windows::Helper)
hash_of_installed_packages = installed_packages
```

#### is_package_installed?

- `package_name` - The name of the package you want to query to see if it is installed
- `returns` - true if the package is installed, false if it the package is not installed

Download a file if a package isn't installed

```ruby
# usage in a recipe to not download a file if package is already installed
::Chef::Recipe.send(:include, Windows::Helper)
is_win_sdk_installed = is_package_installed?('Windows Software Development Kit')

remote_file 'C:\windows\temp\windows_sdk.zip' do
  source 'http://url_to_download/windows_sdk.zip'
  action :create_if_missing
  not_if {is_win_sdk_installed}
end
```

Do something if a package is installed

```ruby
# usage in a provider
include Windows::Helper
if is_package_installed?('Windows Software Development Kit')
  # do something if package is installed
end
```

### Windows::VersionHelper

Helper that allows you to get information of the windows version running on your node. It leverages windows ohai from kernel.os_info, easy to mock and to use even on linux.

#### core_version?

Determines whether given node is running on a windows Core.

```ruby
if ::Windows::VersionHelper.core_version? node
  fail 'Windows Core is not supported'
end
```

#### workstation_version?

Determines whether given node is a windows workstation version (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10)

```ruby
if ::Windows::VersionHelper.workstation_version? node
  fail 'Only server version of windows are supported'
end
```

#### server_version?

Determines whether given node is a windows server version (Server 2003, Server 2008, Server 2012, Server 2016)

```ruby
if ::Windows::VersionHelper.server_version? node
  puts 'Server version of windows are cool'
end
```

#### nt_version

Determines NT version of the given node

```ruby
case ::Windows::VersionHelper.nt_version node
  when '6.0' then 'Windows vista or Server 2008'
  when '6.1' then 'Windows 7 or Server 2008R2'
  when '6.2' then 'Windows 8 or Server 2012'
  when '6.3' then 'Windows 8.1 or Server 2012R2'
  when '10.0' then 'Windows 10'
end
```

## Usage

Place an explicit dependency on this cookbook (using depends in the cookbook's metadata.rb) from any cookbook where you would like to use the Windows-specific resources/providers that ship with this cookbook.

```ruby
depends 'windows'
```
